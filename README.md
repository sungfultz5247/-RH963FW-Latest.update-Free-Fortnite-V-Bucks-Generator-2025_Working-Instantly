V-Bucks are always handy to have in Fortnite. Whether you want to use them to get your hands on a brand-new weapon, an interesting Glider, or some emotes, they are the easiest way to pick up new cosmetics to enjoy in the Battle Royale.

Free codes in Fortnite are (very) occasionally released in bunches, but most of them give out emotes, free Fortnite skins, or any of the game’s various cosmetics rather than V-Bucks which are hard to come by.

Note: Be wary of searching for free codes online, as there are a lot of potential scams out there.

All expired codes
If you’ve attempted to redeem a code and been given an error in response, there’s a chance that the code was time-limited and has expired. These are all of the expired V-Bucks codes that we know of at this time:

How to redeem codes
All of the codes above need to be redeemed in order for players to claim their reward. If you have a code that you’d like to use, the process is simple:

Visit Fortnite’s official website and log in using the appropriate platform information.
Move your cursor over your username in the top right corner of the screen and select the Redeem Code option.
Enter your code in the Access Code box.
Launch Fortnite to confirm that your redemption has gone through — you should see your new total represented by the number at the top right of your screen while in the Item Shop.
How much do V-Bucks cost?
V-Bucks in Fortnite can be purchased with real money. In US currency, one V-Buck is equivalent to around $0.0079900. However, the total price may change depending on how many you buy at once. For example, 1000 V-Bucks will cost you $8.99 / €8.99.

Exchange rates also affect this, meaning that depending on the country you play from, the price of V-Bucks may vary.
